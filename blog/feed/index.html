				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like everything else, open houses have gone digital, which means it’s no longer enough to just clean up your home and throw in a few neighborhood signs. Homes now require an online presence that, much like online dating, woos prospective buyers into seeing them in person.</p>
<p>The way buyers find and visit homes has changed, and so the way you should be selling yours has changed with it. We’ve compiled four open house tips for sellers to be sure your open house is a success— impressing buyers both on and offline. Read on to find out how you can get ready for market day and host your best possible open house.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=GkjjKttoQ2Q&utm_source=hit-content&play=1&utm_source=4" width="853" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<h2>Get Creative and Innovative When You Market Your Home</h2>
<p>Probably one of the biggest changes to the housing marketplace in recent years is how much of it gets done online. Says <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2015/05/21/14-steps-to-a-flawless-open-house">Teresa Mears of US News</a>, “According to 2014 data from the National Association of Realtors, 92 percent of homebuyers use the Internet in their search, and that makes listing your open house online important.” Buyers aren’t just locating homes for sale online, they’re also deciding (based on listings they find and what they look like) which homes are actually worth visiting.</p>
<p>So even if you like to live out of the limelight, your house is going to need a <a href="../sell-your-house-online/index.html">killer social media life.</a> Work with your real estate agent to create an appealing online profile for your home: Align on your home’s best features, familiarize your agent with neighborhood benefits, and stage your property so that it photographs well.</p>
<p>If you don’t make buyers fall in love with your home’s profile, it’s likely they’ll never even get to see it in person. Says <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/8-tips-for-a-successful-open-house-1.aspx">Dana Dratch of Bankrate,</a> “Because most buyers start their searches on computers, you need a professional presentation online.”</p>
<p>But where to post your perfected home profile? You’ll want to cast a wide net and post your home’s profile in as many places as possible. “Make sure your open house is listed in the <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/multiple-listing-services-in-real-estate-2866909">multiple listing service</a> as well as on all the major real estate portals and Craigslist,” says Mears. “You can also share the information on <a href="https://nextdoor.com/">Nextdoor.com</a> and neighborhood email lists.”</p>
<p>And don’t forget about some of the old-school marketing tricks you can do offline as well. While you shouldn’t rely exclusively on signs and flyers, these things still never hurt and are especially important the closer you get to your open house date.</p>
<p>“In addition to putting a sign on your front lawn,” says Mear “put signs at major intersections directing people to the house. Tying balloons to the signs makes them more visible.” You want to be sure people can easily find your house, otherwise all your online marketing efforts will be for nothing.</p>
<p>Another great strategy is to switch up your signs as you get closer to the date of your open house. Swap out “for sale” signs with “open house” ones using something called riders. Says Dratch, “Called ‘riders’ because they ride on top of your ‘for sale’ sign, the attachments are available from home improvement stores and you can usually get them pre-printed with ‘Open house Saturday’ or ‘Open house Sunday’.”</p>

<h2>Give Your House A Mini-Makeover</h2>
<p>Don’t worry, this won’t be quite like an HGTV makeover, but there’s still a few things you should do to get your home open-house ready. Clean, fresh, and inviting are all good words to keep in mind when preparing your home. Be sure to spend at least a day or two doing a <a href="../house-cleaning-checklist/index.html">major cleaning,</a> then make a cleaning schedule you can stick to in the weeks before your open house.</p>
<hr />
<p><span data-sumome-listbuilder-embed-id="92cf87f7356490edd830779cf2b61a5adadea7838a8182bb7fae8e55d242ea46"></span></p>
<hr />
<p>Pay special attention to the exterior of your home as well as the entrance— these first impressions are important. Make the inside feel bright and inviting, and don’t leave any messes or smells lingering from food, pets, or kids. Says real estate agent <a href="../../agents/moureen-hardy-ca-01190642/index.html">Moureen Hardy</a> of <a href="../../orange-county-ca/top-real-estate-agents/index.html">Orange County, California,</a> “The property has to be in <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2015/05/21/14-steps-to-a-flawless-open-house">pristine condition</a> when you have the open house.”</p>
<p>Be sure to neutralize rooms in your home as much as possible. Remove family photos and paint over walls that are too bright or too dark. Says Dratch, “If you have anything that could be considered the least bit controversial (like an animal head on the wall, or a photo of you with a polarizing politico), take it down for the duration.”</p>
<p>Houses should also be minimally furnished. “If the house has too many pieces of furniture and knickknacks,” says Mears, “it&#8217;s hard for potential buyers to see the home&#8217;s features.” Homes should be decorated sparsely and with a neutral and elegant design in mind— in other words, you want your home to appeal to as many buyers as possible.</p>

<h2>Highlight Your Home’s Best Features</h2>
<p>Every home has features that are more desirable than others. Taking the time to understand what the greatest assets of your home (and neighborhood) are will help you to have a competitive edge in the market.</p>
<p>Spend some time gathering information about great local restaurants and regular local events. Sit down with your realtor and add this information to your home’s online profile and decide if there’s a need to print out flyers for the day of the open house as well.</p>
<p>Work with your realtor to identify the parts of your home that will most appeal to buyers. Stage these areas well and be sure to take good photos that highlight these features. Some realtors and sellers even go as far as adding little notes around the home on the day of open house that highlight its most desirable features. For example, “Walk in closet, check it out.” Decide with your realtor how you can best showcase these assets to your buyers, making sure to highlight them online, in person, or both.</p>
<p>One of the best ways you can advocate for your home on the day of open house is to invite the neighbors. “Many times neighbors attend open houses, even if they&#8217;re not looking to move, out of curiosity,” says Mears. “Most agents encourage that, and some even send flyers to neighbors because they may have friends and relatives who are looking for a home.” Top real estate agent <a href="../../agents/maribel-sotuyo-tx-0655341/index.html">Maribel Sotuyo</a> of <a href="../../houston-tx/top-real-estate-agents/index.html">Houston, Texas</a> says, “Your neighbors will always know someone. Your friends and neighbors are your best avenue as far as marketing a home for you.”</p>
<p>While having your neighbors poke around your home might not be your idea of a successful open house, it almost always means you have a better chance of selling. Ultimately, you want as many people to see your home as possible, even the neighbors. “They’re the people who want their friends to come move into the neighborhood,” says Pat Vredevoogd Combs, former president of the National Association of Realtors. “They’re my scouts.”</p>

<h2>Run Errands During Showings&#8211;Don’t Stick Around</h2>
<p>One thing you may not be expecting as a first-time seller is that real estate agents will often want you out of the house for showings. After helping with the open house prep in one form or another, this might feel like a rejection— but it’s not.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a lot of strategy behind having homeowners out during these events. Says Sotuyo, “Here’s what tends to happen: When someone walks in a home they’re not going to love every single thing about it and [homeowners] want to justify things— that does more harm than good.”</p>
<p>Sotuyo also explains that homeowners have been known to bring up issues in the home without meaning to, often as a way of justifying certain features or renovation decisions they made.</p>
<p>Overall, agents want buyers to have a chance to visualize the home as their own, which is pretty hard (not to mention awkward) with its former tenant looming. “If you have an agent, there’s no reason for you to attend your own open house,” says Dratch. “So grab the pets and get out of the way. Buyers need to picture themselves in the house. That’s more difficult if you’re around.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re writing your list of things to repair and upgrade before selling your home, chances are the backyard is on the bottom. True, <a href="../house-cleaning-checklist/index.html">sprucing up the interior</a> and enhancing your home’s front yard curb appeal are top priority, but shifting trends among home buyers say that your backyard curb appeal needs some attention, too.</p>
<p>A recent study by The American Institute of Architects (AIA) found that outdoor living spaces remain a top priority for home designers in the first quarter of 2017. That trend continued to rise in popularity in the second quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Styling an outdoor living room on your porch, deck or patio isn’t the only reason potential buyers are interested in homes with functional backyards. A recent landscaping survey by <a href="https://info.houzz.com/rs/804-JLJ-529/images/HouzzLandscapeStudy2017.pdf">Houzz.com</a> found that homeowners (and future homeowners) want backyards with space for things like gardening and playing with family and pets, too.</p>
<p>If it looks like you don’t enjoy spending time in your own backyard, buyers won’t want to either. However, getting your yard in shape doesn’t mean you need to install or upgrade every outdoor feature buyer’s might want.</p>
<p>When it’s time to sell your home, the key is to show off your backyard’s potential to prospective buyers. Here are a few tips to whip your backyard into shape.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3441" style="max-width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3441 size-full" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-lawn.jpg" alt="Backyard curb appeal: take care of your lawn" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-lawn.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-lawn-300x200.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-lawn-405x270.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seanhobson/4353671803">Sean Hobson</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Nurture the Nature with a Bit of Backyard Lawn Care</h2>
<p>No one wants to buy a house with a backyard that looks like a lot of work, so you’ll need to give your greenery a makeover. The National Association of Realtors’ (NAR) 2016 Remodeling Impact Report on Outdoor Features lists lawn care programs and landscaping upgrades as the top draws for buyers.</p>
<p>According to their report, starting a basic program of fertilizer and weed control before you sell can net you an average 303% return on your investment (ROI).</p>
<p>All those trees you’ve been meaning to trim and flowerbeds that need weeding need to be taken care of, too. The national <a href="https://www.improvenet.com/r/costs-and-prices/lawn-care-cost-estimator">cost for lawn and garden maintenance averages around $226</a>, depending upon the size of the yard and services needed.</p>
<p>Just ask your professional landscaper to trim lightly when shaping hedges and trees that provide privacy from your neighbors. <a href="../../agents/angela-fox-co-fa40043577/index.html">Angela Fox</a>, a Denver-based realtor who ranks in the top 1% out of 14,046 agents, says, “It’s a market thing. When all the trees are bare, you can see through that. So you definitely want to clean up landscaping in the backyard while keeping that privacy.”</p>
<p>For a barren backyard light on plant life, you may want to skip the maintenance costs and invest in some fresh landscaping instead. The NAR lists <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/home-and-design/feature/article/2017/12/whats-hot-trends-in-pipeline-for-2018">spiritual gardens</a> as a top trend for 2018.</p>
<p>When your selecting your plants, Houzz’s landscaping report notes that low-maintenance greenery is a growing trend. So opt for plants designed to last, <a href="http://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/how-to/g3023/landscaping-ideas-for-low-maintenance-yard/?slide=8">like perennials</a> or <a href="https://www.doityourself.com/stry/diy-a-low-maintenance-succulent-garden">succulents.</a></p>

<p>If your yard has a dedicated garden patch, but your lack of a green thumb has kept you from planting, don’t worry. You can easily stage your garden by tilling the earth and marking the rows with <a href="https://themicrogardener.com/20-creative-diy-plant-labels-markers/">creative plant labels.</a> Just make sure you actually plant the seeds or let buyers know that the signs are just for show.</p>
<p>Backyards without a dedicated garden can still appeal to buyers interested in the <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/news-and-commentary/feature/article/2015/07/rise-backyard-farm">gardening trend</a> by planting an <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/flowers-and-plants/edible-container-ideas-are-lip-smackingly-good-pictures">edible container garden.</a> Plus, container plants both edible and decorative are a great way to liven up bare spots in your backyard with greenery.</p>
<p>Getting your lawn and garden elements are in tip-top shape isn’t the only tending your backyard needs. If you’ve got other outdoor amenities like a pool or a patio, they also need maintenance and staging.</p>

<h2>Swimming Pool Staging Tips to Help Your House Sell</h2>
<p>Many homeowners say they always wanted a house with a pool—until they actually had one. Ongoing expenses, like chlorine and utility costs for running the pump, average <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/pool-increase-decrease-home-value">around $15-$25 weekly.</a> This can make a pool feel like it’s more work than it’s worth.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that having a background pool will automatically make your home less valuable or harder to sell. Architectural Digest lists <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/5-outdoor-features-that-will-add-value-to-your-home">pools as one of the top five outdoor features</a> that add value to a home. And the NAR reports that buyers perceive both in-ground and aboveground pools as adding value to the home—especially in warmer regions.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3449" style="max-width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3449" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-pool-1.jpg" alt="Backyard curb appeal: pools" width="576" height="356" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-pool-1.jpg 576w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-pool-1-300x185.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/backyard-curb-appeal-pool-1-437x270.jpg 437w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image via <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/home-and-design/architecture-coach/article/2013/06/clarifying-home-pool-choices">Realtor®Mag</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re selling a home that has an in-ground pool in the backyard, you’ll need refurbish and stage it so that potential buyers focus on its benefits rather than its drawbacks. Your pool should be full with properly-treated water to prevent algae growth and repair any damage to your pool’s deck or interior surface.</p>
<p>Pools with stained or crumbling interiors must be resurfaced before you list or you risk scaring off potential buyers. Although prices vary depending upon the pool size, type and the region you live in, the cost to resurface a plaster pool averages around <a href="https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-much-does-it-cost-resurface-swimming-pool.htm">$4 per square foot.</a></p>
<p>However, plaster pool surfacing is on the decline, so it might be worth the additional expense to opt for a longer-lasting pebble-based resurfacing which averages around $5 per square foot.</p>
<p>After the pool has been refurbished it’s time to stage the area to help buyers envision themselves using the pool. First, add a few accessories to the pool itself that reflect the atmosphere of your neighborhood. For example, if you live in a family-friendly suburb, float a few inflatable pool toys. In upscale areas, <a href="https://quickcandles.com/ideas/use-floating-candles-pool/">float flowers or candles instead.</a></p>
<p>Next, arrange lounge chairs and outdoor end tables in comfortable groupings around the pool deck. Add to the oft-used ambience with colorful beach towels and outdoor-friendly throw pillows.</p>
<p>Make the pool area extra-enticing during open houses by setting out glasses and a drinks dispenser filled with sun-tea or cucumber water near the lounge chairs. A beverage station in the backyard invites buyers to linger after touring your home to discuss becoming its new owners.</p>
<p>Of course, if your backyard doesn’t feature a pool, you can create your beverage station in your backyard living area.</p>

<h2>Cater to the Indoor-Outdoor Lifestyle With a Lively Outdoor Living Area</h2>
<p>One of the reasons backyards are becoming more important in real estate sales trends is due to the <a href="https://www.aia.org/articles/148061-advances-in-window-technology-augment-the-i">rise of the indoor-outdoor lifestyle.</a> Architects in both urban and suburban areas are designing new houses with giant doors and windows that practically open up a whole wall to bring the outdoors in.</p>
<p>If your home doesn’t feature massive doors or windows like these, you can still appeal to those indoor-outdoor loving buyers with a dedicated outdoor living area. Whether it’s a deck, patio or porch, dedicated <a href="http://styledstagedsold.blogs.realtor.org/2014/04/28/more-home-owners-carve-out-outdoor-entertainment-spaces/">outdoor living spaces</a> create the ambience of having a “bonus room.”</p>
<p>Both wood and stone get weathered over time so be sure to <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/outdoor-design/outdoor-spaces/decks--porches-and-patios/dos-and-donts-for-deck-and-patio-maintenance-pictures">clean and treat your deck</a>, porch and patios properly before listing. The national cost to refinish a wood deck <a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/outdoor-living/refinish-a-deck/">averages around $775.</a> The cost to refurbish a patio made of stone, brick or pavers varies due to size and material type, with the national average costing <a href="https://www.improvenet.com/r/costs-and-prices/patio-walkway-repair-cost">between $777 to $1,360.</a></p>
<p>If your backyard doesn’t already have a deck or patio, you <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/real-estate/maximum-value-outdoor-living-projects-patio">may want to add one.</a> The NAR’s Outdoor Features Impact Report indicates that you’ll see a positive return on your investment:</p>
<p>If the expense of a professionally constructed porch, deck or patio is out of your budget, you can achieve the same effect by <a href="https://www.hunker.com/13424615/how-to-build-a-patio-on-grass">a brick or pavers patio</a> directly on your lawn. Just make sure you select a location for the in-ground patio that makes sense with your home’s layout without taking away too much of your lawn.</p>
<p>How you <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/home-and-design/slideshow/staging-outdoor-spaces">stage your outdoor living area</a> all depends on the space and where it’s located. For example, a deck off the kitchen is the perfect place for an outdoor dining set, while a <a href="http://styledstagedsold.blogs.realtor.org/2017/09/25/why-you-should-stage-a-cozy-fire-pit-area/">fire pit</a> is safest on an in-lawn patio well away from the house itself. Give these spaces that extra-enticing touch with place settings on the table and cozy throws on the seating around the fire pit.</p>
<p>Nosy neighbors are the last thing you want potential buyers to worry about while their appraising your outdoor living areas. So if a lack of privacy is an issue your backyard has, you’ll definitely want to address it.</p>
<p>Fox advises, “Sometimes I have clients either hang curtains or some kind of sun drape, if there is a neighbor that’s really close. Or sometimes you can plant a couple of trees. In one case, my clients mitigated that concern by adding a six-foot privacy fence.”</p>
<p>When it comes to getting your home’s backyard ready to sell, your main goal is to create a space that’s both functional and inviting to buyers. With a mix of basic maintenance, clever staging and a few minor upgrades you can easily (and relatively inexpensively) transform your existing backyard into an outdoor living oasis.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Preparing your home for sale is one of the most important parts of selling. It might feel like a big job, but it doesn't have to be. Here's how to do it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Preparing your home for sale might feel like a huge undertaking, but it doesn’t have to be. Sure, there’s going to be some work involved. But by starting early and tackling sections of your house at a time, you can ensure that when your house finally does hit the market, buyers are both impressed and interested. Plus, <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/infographics/staged-for-success">according to the National Association of Realtors,</a> 62% of agents say that homes that are staged and spotless spend <em>less</em> time on the market.</p>
<p>So what are the things you should do to get your home ready? In this article we’ll cover exactly that, telling you what to fix, what to clean, and how you can ready your home step by step.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to get it all done at once, a great strategy is to start from the outside and work your way in. Starting from the home’s exterior guarantees that you catch everything a buyer will notice on their first visit, and it also allows you to tackle these items in the order they’ll be seen. The best thing to do throughout this process is to focus on impressions: Think about what a buyer will see, touch, and smell. If it doesn’t look good to you, it definitely won’t to them.</p>
<p>Ready to get started? Read on for our step-by-step guide to preparing your home for sale, and get one step closer to closing that deal.</p>

<h2>1. Spruce Up Your Home’s Exterior</h2>
<p><a href="../curb-appeal-guide/index.html">Curb appeal is incredibly important</a> in the success of a sale. In some cases, real estate agents have even reported clients making a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2015/04/01/how-much-value-does-landscaping-add-to-your-home-when-selling/">150% return on a landscaping investment</a> in the final sale price of the home.</p>
<p>Everything from your walkway to the paint that might be chipping by the front door, these minor details can make or break your buyer’s first impressions— which is what curb appeal is all about. To get your home ready, take a stroll up to your front door making notes of what it might need.</p>
<p>Mowing the lawn and refreshing the landscaping is a must (pull those weeds!), but some less obvious ideas might include renting a power-washer to clean the exterior, fixing any damage that’s visible from the front door, and making sure your home address number (if you have one) is visible.</p>
<p>It also never hurts to give your front door a fresh coat of paint that invites buyers in. Top real estate agent <a href="../../agents/maribel-sotuyo-tx-0655341/index.html">Maribel Sotuyo</a> of Houston, Texas says, “If a home doesn’t look visually appealing from outside, often [buyers] don’t even want to step inside.”</p>
<p>For a buyer, curb appeal is more than just what the outside looks like. In the words of the <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/real-estate/10-ways-to-prep-your-home-for-sale">HGTV experts,</a> “A sloppy exterior will make buyers think you&#8217;ve slacked off on interior maintenance as well.” Buyers tend to leap to conclusions based on minor details.</p>
<p>Says Sotuyo, “I spend a lot of time right next to the door getting the lock box open, and so [a buyer] is standing there looking around, and if they notice there’s a few items that could easily be maintained and they’re not, then they’re going to assume maybe other things aren’t maintained.”</p>
<p>Bottom line: Make the outside look awesome so you don’t lose your buyer before they even get inside.</p>

<h2>2. Make The Entryway Feel Inviting</h2>
<p>The entrance of your home is the next most important piece in getting it ready for sale. If the exterior works to convince buyers to take a closer look, then the entrance should really make them swoon!</p>
<p>Entryways should feel warm, bright, and pull the buyer inside. Anything dark, gloomy, or overcrowded and you may just scare your buyer back out the door. One of the first and most important things you can do for your entryway is to remove excess furniture.</p>
<p>Sotuyo advises her clients to be aware of small entrances and to be sure there’s a clear pathway to other rooms. She encourages homeowners to put bulky or oversized furniture in storage (even if it’s really nice stuff). Less is more, and overcrowding a room will do nothing except make it look smaller.</p>
<p>After eliminating some furniture, take a look around at what else needs TLC. Cobwebs hiding in corners and on top of ceiling fans should be promptly dusted, and curtains should be thrown open to let light in. As a general rule, your real estate agent will show the home with windows uncovered and lights on (for maximum light) so be sure you go through your home in the same way.</p>

<h2>3. Create Welcoming Spaces Throughout</h2>
<p>After ensuring a grand entrance for your buyer, it’s time to tackle the rest of the home. Every room should be tidy, clean, and neutral. That means no aggressively colored walls or artwork. Sure, you might like this one incredible painter who splashes red and yellow onto the canvas— but your buyer probably does not. Try to make your home appealing to everyone.</p>
<p>Besides being clean, nothing in your home should appear overtly broken. This doesn’t mean that everything has to be in working order, it just means it should have the appearance of working. Many buyers don’t mind if a home needs some minor repair work— what they do mind is if it looks neglected.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean spending hours or even hundreds of dollars on repairs. A lot of quick fixes are available to the savvy seller, and things like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/realestate/preparing-your-home-for-sale.html">updating worn kitchen or bathroom areas</a> with peel and stick tiles or epoxy coating can go a long way in enhancing the appearance of your home. Says Sotuyo, “if done well [these projects] actually make a big difference, even if it’s DIY.”</p>
<p>Similarly, investing in fresh linens can do wonders to liven up a space. Throw a new white duvet on an old comforter in a bedroom, or line up white hand towels in a bathroom. “Cleanliness is more than [a home] being visually appealing, it appeals to the buyer in a psychological way,” says Sotuyo.</p>

<h2>4. Organize Your Storage</h2>
<p>Don’t spend so much time on the rooms in your home that you forget all about the closets. It isn’t just curiosity that drives buyers to look behind closed doors, there’s also a more practical reason. “Buyers are opening closets to see what kind of space they’ll have,” explains Sotuyo who reminds her clients how vital this storage space can be— especially in parts of the country where homes don’t have basements or significant attic space.</p>
<p>Before you clean out your closets entirely, consider keeping some of your stuff and storing it in stacked boxes away from the door. This is actually better than leaving closets empty as it gives buyers an idea of the storage space they’ll have.</p>
<p>Some sellers even go as far as leaving nice shirts on hangers or stuffing brand-name shopping bags with tissue paper on shelves. Whatever you choose to do, just be sure closets aren’t cluttered but organized. Same goes for the drawers. Expect things to be opened and organize accordingly.</p>
<h2>Final Steps in Preparing Your Home for Sale</h2>
<p>Before you finish preparing your home for sale, do a final walkthrough. Try to take in your space as the buyer would. How does each room feel? Does anything stand out as ugly, broken, or dirty? Is there a clear pathway between each room? Prep your house with the buyer in mind and you’re sure to impress them when it comes time to sell.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solar panels are one of those tricky things we all like to believe increase the value of a home. After all they save homeowners a ton of money, right? Well that depends. Says real estate agent <a href="../../agents/aaron-zapata-ca-1356534/index.html">Aaron Zapata</a> of <a href="https://www.inman.com/2017/01/30/4-solar-panel-pitfalls-ive-faced-with-real-estate-clients/">Inman</a>, “According to FHA and Fannie Mae, whether solar panels add value or are viewed as a liability is still unclear.”</p>
<p>While many websites selling solar will lead you to believe it’s the best possible investment for your home, the true benefits of solar (especially for a potential buyer interested in your home) depend on quite a few factors. Read on for some definitive truths about solar that can help you decide if and when to install, and how to best market your property if you’ve already made the plunge.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3430" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solar-panels-property-value-location.jpg" alt="Do solar panels increase property value? Consider your location." width="750" height="454" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solar-panels-property-value-location.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solar-panels-property-value-location-300x182.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solar-panels-property-value-location-446x270.jpg 446w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></h2>
<h2>Consider Your Location</h2>
<p>Plenty of solar companies like to quote the savings you’ll generate on the hottest and longest days of the year. Says top 1% real estate agent <a href="../../agents/thomas-braunagel-ct-res0779038/index.html">Thomas Braunagel</a> of <a href="../../bridgeport-ct/top-real-estate-agents/index.html">Bridgeport, CT</a>, “Anybody can quote this super efficient July 15th, but what really counts is when you average it out over the course of the year.” And this means factoring in the rainy months and potentially long winters too.</p>
<p>While that doesn’t necessarily rule out solar in places with long winters and rainy seasons, it’s something to consider. Do your homework and cross-check information to be sure you’re signing up for a solar package that will truly generate savings, not only for you but for future buyers as well.</p>
<h2>Do The Savings Apply?</h2>
<p>We’ve all heard <a href="http://realestate.boston.com/home-improvement/2017/02/14/solar-panels-worth/">the quotes like these</a>: “The average Massachusetts household paying $100 a month for electricity can save an estimated $35,900 over the next 20 years — almost $1,800 a year.” And while that all sounds pretty great, the real question remains: Are you planning on staying in your home that long? Because if not, the 10k loan you take to access that savings might not be worth it, especially if you only stay in the home a few more years and end up owing the solar company money when it comes time to sell.</p>
<h2>Owning Vs. Leasing Matters</h2>
<p>While this might not be at all obvious to the unsuspecting homeowner, there’s a big difference between owning and leasing your solar panels— especially when it’s time to sell the home later on. We’re guessing the solar company might’ve left this detail out, as they like to say leasing is one of the “cheapest and easiest” ways to acquire a solar package— but the truth of the matter is that if you did lease your solar package (and the lease is still current), this complicates selling your home quite a bit.</p>
<h2>Extra Cost</h2>
<p>Assuming buyers are considering your home and leased solar panel package- they’re likely already crunching the numbers on what this transferred lease will cost them. Says Zapata, “I have found that most buyers don’t want to buy a home with a leased solar panel system because of the additional monthly cost. For some reason, buyers don’t see the value in lower energy bills. All they see is the increased minimum monthly payments.”</p>
<h2>Difficulty Securing Loans</h2>
<p>Another point to consider is that sometimes banks won’t even grant a buyer a loan on a property if there’s a leased solar package involved. Says top luxury real estate agent <a href="../../agents/zaragoza-m-ca-01323788/index.html">Pam Zaragoza</a> of <a href="../../burlingame-ca/top-real-estate-agents/index.html">Burlingame, CA</a>, “If [the panels] are leased it’s difficult to get a loan, and there are many more steps. If they’re owned it’s easier to buy the house and the loan process is much easier. Certain lenders will not even give loans on a home leased with solar panels.”</p>
<h2>The Question of Warranty</h2>
<p>Many buyers will also want to know about the warranty on the solar package, especially if they’re not incredibly thrilled to be stuck with solar in the first place. Zaragoza mentions that you should always ask your solar provider what will happen to your warranty if you decide to sell the home. Knowing that you can transfer the warranty to new owners offers them a big peace of mind, and if this isn’t possible, then this might be a reason to reconsider the purchase or lease agreement.</p>
<h2>Transferring Leased Solar</h2>
<p>The reason transferring leased solar is so complicated is that it’s an outstanding investment of yours that you must now (somehow) pass on to someone else. Imagine yourself as a buyer walking into someone’s home and them casually mentioning a leased car that comes with the property. If you never wanted another car, this would be a problem. Leased solar packages are the same. Ultimately they’re a liability for a new owner who may have never wanted them in the first place, and this type of sticky transaction can make the sale of your home that much more complicated.</p>
<p>Says Zapata, “If a homebuyer decides to purchase a property with leased solar panels, that buyer must qualify for the solar lease with the solar company. This often affects the buyer’s purchasing ability and could disqualify a buyer from purchasing the home once the mandatory solar lease is added to the payment calculations by their lender.”</p>

<h2>Do Solar Panels Increase Property Value? The Positives and Negatives, In Short</h2>
<h3>When Solar Helps</h3>
<p>Solar can be valuable investment for future buyers when it’s been recently installed and when you’re living in a location where it’s becoming the norm. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2014/03/26/real-estate-matters-are-solar-panels-worth-the-investment/?utm_term=.132cec36e12a">Says Ilyce R. Glink and Samuel J. Tamkin of the Washington Post,</a> “If lots of homes in your area have solar panels, and buyers are learning to expect them, adding them might give you something extra to promote your home when it comes time to sell. However, if few homes have solar panels and buyers tend not to pay for the investment, you might not get back the money you put into the panels.”</p>
<p>Another point to consider is if your home has certain features generating high electricity bills that might call for solar. If for example you run a heated inground pool every summer (or all year), then solar might be a way to help mitigate these expenses, and this is a very real application of savings you can explain to future buyers.</p>
<h3>When Solar Hurts</h3>
<p>Solar hurts when it’s a little older, and leased. As previously mentioned, it can be nearly impossible for buyers to secure a loan when leased solar panels are involved. Technology changes constantly and buyers will be less than impressed with your 10-year old solar dreams than they will with a newer package. Says Braunagel, “I do a lot of [deals with solar], and for me, they’re a pain in the neck, they get in the way of sales. In many cases homeowners don’t know what the contract is like, and most people don’t buy them, they lease them which is a thorn in my side. So many buyers end up asking about a payout to have a contractor come remove them.”</p>

Think like a buyer." width="750" height="500" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solar-panels-property-value-buyer.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solar-panels-property-value-buyer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/solar-panels-property-value-buyer-405x270.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></h2>
<h2>Think Like A Buyer</h2>
<p>When installing solar in your home, or figuring out how to market a home with an existing solar package, you really need to think about what the investment looks like from a buyer perspective. According to Glink and Tamkin, “While the investment in the solar panels might be great for you in the long term, if you have to resell the home, will a buyer consider the solar investment something that adds value to the home?”</p>
<p>If you haven’t pulled the trigger on installing solar quite yet, it’s worth considering something called a <a href="https://www.energysage.com/solar/community-solar/community-solar-power-explained/">“solar community”</a>. Depending on where you live you may be able to buy into a solar farm and reap some of the benefits of solar without having to install actual panels on your home— a viable option if selling is in the near future.</p>
<p>As far as the time-old question of if you should install solar in your home, Zaragoza says “Technology changes all the time keeps getting better and better, in my opinion— solar panels still have a long way to go.”</p>
<p>So if you haven’t purchased them yet, maybe hit the pause button on that investment.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Real estate agent Caroline Lunny just left empty handed. Could season 22 villain Chelsea Roy beat out other real estate talent for the final rose?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a fan of ABC’s The Bachelor, then you’ve probably noticed the <a href="https://www.inman.com/2018/01/02/bachelor-s22-packed-with-real-estate-pros/">amount of real estate talent this season.</a> A handful of the girls work in the real estate industry and the Bachelor himself, former race car driver <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelor/cast/bachelor-arie-luyendyk-jr">Arie Luyendyk Jr.</a>, is an agent with Re/Max in Arizona.</p>
<p>The season 22 real estate women couldn’t be more different. There’s Chelsea who came out of the gate as a major villain and got the first impression rose. There’s Seinne who kicked some serious bumper in the demolition derby date. There’s Ashley, who’s been pretty quiet so far (dark horse anyone?). There’s Caroline, who’s in her first year as a real estate agent with Re/Max in Miami/Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3426" style="max-width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3426 size-full" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/caroline-lunny-bachelor-realtor-e1516733265838.png" alt="Caroline Lunny bachelor real estate agent got sent home last night!" width="750" height="409" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image via ABC</figcaption></figure>
<p>Caroline just left without a rose. She stepped out of the limo with this gem: “I do know you’re a realtor. I’m also a realtor, so maybe by the end of this, if we both do our jobs right, we’ll both be ‘off the market.’”</p>
<p>ABC showed us more drama between Caroline and Krystal than they did Caroline’s time with Arie, so it’s no surprise that she got cut.</p>
<p>She’s the first real estate contestant to be kicked off the show, which leads us to the ultimate question: who’s the real estate agent who has the best chance to get the final rose?</p>

<h3>3. Ashley Luebke: Dark Horse or Next to Be Eliminated?</h3>
<p>We’ve heard it before. “She’s going to win the whole thing. She’s a total dark horse, they just haven’t shown her yet.” This is a tricky tightrope to walk.</p>
<p>Usually the biggest contenders don’t get a ton of screen time at the beginning of the season in favor of the quirky, mean, or crazy contestants. They do, however, get a little bit, and Ashley has barely gotten any. This unpredictability (even though Ashley seems wonderful) gives her our #3 spot.</p>

<h3>2. Villains Gotta Vill, But Villains Rarely Win &#8211; Down Goes Chelsea Roy</h3>
<p>Chelsea came out of the gate with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-bachelor-who-is-chelsea-2018-1">talons blazing.</a> She labeled herself as the villain from day one, and when she secured the first impression rose, she put a target on her own back.</p>
<p>Chelsea is losing her edge, though. <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelor/video/most-recent/VDKA4254327">Krystal</a> is emerging as this seasons true mean girl. As Chelsea focuses less on drama with the other girls and more on her connection with the “Racing Realtor,” she may become more of a favorite in the eyes of Bachelor Nation.</p>
<p>There’s a catch, though. Usually when a contestant is portrayed as “the villian” early on, she doesn’t get the final rose (<a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/17350-the-bachelor-names-nikki-as-juan-pablos-villain-but-theyve-got-it-all-wrong">with the exception of Nikki Ferrell</a>). That’s why Chelsea isn’t a favorite of ours to win the final rose, though we do expect her to make the final four.</p>

<h3>1. Sienne Fleming Could Parasail Right into Arie’s Heart</h3>
<p>Seinne currently works as an associate at a commercial brokerage. Previous to this role, she was an Assistant Property Manager for a different commercial real estate company. Seinne also recently got her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVvhitPHPDQ/?taken-by=seinnefleming">yoga instructor certification</a> (talk about renaissance woman!).</p>
<p>We finally got some screen time with Seinne last night, and her date with Arie was adorable. Parasailing, a picnic on the beach, and slow dancing to LANCO? Plus, Seinne is smart, beautiful, and charming, and she works in real estate.</p>
<p>The <a href="../find-real-estate-agent-family-home/index.html">best real estate agents</a> are great communicators, genuine, outgoing, and kind. Those qualities also make for a great companion. So far, Seinne has fit all of that criteria and more, so she’s our real estate favorite to win the whole thing.</p>
<p>Do you agree? Tweet us which real estate agent you think will get the final rose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you’re selling your home, but don’t have the budget to spend money on staging your house. You may know all about your <a href="../staging-a-house-while-living-in-it/index.html">options for hiring professional stagers,</a> or <a href="../real-estate-open-house-ideas/index.html">key strategies for throwing a great open house,</a> but you really can’t spend a dime. Fortunately, staging a house on a budget is a totally viable option.</p>
<p>In fact, if you were getting discouraged and thinking about sacking the whole idea, don’t. Here’s why. <a href="https://www.easyagentpro.com/blog/home-staging-ideas/">Real estate writer Tyler Zey says</a>, “Research has shown the average sale price of a property can be increased by 1-5% simply because <a href="../getting-a-house-ready-to-sell/index.html">home staging tips</a> were implemented before the house hit the market.” Those tips don’t have to be set in motion by a pro&#8211;they’re simple changes any homeowner can make.</p>
<p>Staging your home isn’t only important for the open house, it’s also a vital part of marketing it online— which is how buyers are likely to find your house anyway. “If you can’t afford the price of a professional home stager,” says <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2017/09/12/how-to-diy-home-staging-on-a-budget/">real estate agent Justin Pierce,</a> “I don’t recommend that you leave a home completely void. You need to try to make your home sparkle a little, especially for the photos.”</p>
<p>Ready to get started staging your home on a budget? Read on— we’ve got some quick and easy ideas that will make your house look great (and more importantly won’t cost a dime).</p>

Take a look at this infographic from the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/infographics/staged-for-success">National Association of Realtors.</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Neutralize and Deep Clean Your Home&#8217;s Interior and Exterior</h2>
<p>The first step in staging your home is, you guessed it, to <a href="../house-cleaning-checklist/index.html">clean like mad.</a></p>
<h3>1. Straighten up your home’s exterior.</h3>
<p>That may mean pulling a few weeds and even giving some much-needed TLC to the garden. “Make sure you have some curb appeal,” advises top real estate agent Maribel Sotuyo of Texas. “Plant some flowers or throw some mulch.” Whatever your buyer will see on their way into your home should look flawless.</p>
<h3>2. Pack up the majority of your things.</h3>
<p>Then get ready to get packing. “Try to pack up each room by 30%,” says Zey. “This will create a bigger feeling to every room in the house.” After you’ve packed up and cleaned (with special attention to bathrooms and kitchens), it’s time to do a de-clutter walk through. Says Sotuyo, “Declutter- don’t stash it anywhere else. Just get rid of it.”</p>
<p>Clutter doesn’t just mean loose papers and dog toys on the floor— it also applies to your countertop. Zey advises, “Remove items from the kitchen counters such as coffee makers, toasters, microwaves, etc. These items take up space and crowd the view.” Make countertops sparse except for a vase or two, and homey items like a clean wooden cutting board.</p>
<p>And don’t forget about the closets. Your buyers will open them, and it’s best they look minimal and organized. Some professional stagers use tricks like stuffing tissue paper in designer bags to line closet shelves. Well-organized closets (whether with paper bags or bins) help a buyer identify the space they will have better than an empty ones. So don’t worry about getting rid of everything in your closet just yet— just make sure that what you leave looks good.</p>
<p>From there, work to make your home seem as neutral as possible— meaning that someone (with exceptional taste of course) lives there, but it’s not necessarily you. Take down personal family photos and try to think like a buyer: What would you want to see? Assess your best decorative pieces throughout the home; these will be useful to keep in mind as you stage.</p>
<h3>3. Deep clean every room in the house.</h3>
<p>Open all windows for fresh air regularly and scrub smelly sinks and toilets. Use <a href="https://www.easyagentpro.com/blog/home-staging-ideas/">Zey’s trick for keeping kitchens smelling fresh:</a> “Get rid of kitchen odors by pouring hot salt water down the drain twice a week. Also, grind some lemon rind into the disposal.”</p>
<p>To keep the house clean, consider wiping down all spaces and doing a quick mop (<a href="https://swiffer.com/en-us/shop-products/mopping">Swiffer WetJet</a> works great in this situation) and vacuum every morning before you go to work.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vt9_Ias3VX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Maximize Your Space</h2>
<p>The best way to stage your home with your existing furniture is to rearrange items according to a new set of priorities: instead of being a home that serves your needs, think of it now as a show-home. Sotuyo advises her clients to focus on the living room, <a href="../staging-a-bedroom/index.html">the bedroom,</a> and the kitchen when it comes to staging. “Bathrooms are so small,” she says. “It’s the bigger rooms that [buyers] will be spending time in.”</p>
<p>Rearrange your living room furniture to create a social space but make sure you still have adequate room for foot traffic. &#8220;Be sure that the living room furniture is positioned for conversation as well as entertainment,” advise <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/home-and-design/feature/article/2009/03/staging-budget">real estate agents Rana Lindhorst and Troy Schmidt of Illinois.</a> “Potential buyers should be able to easily envision sitting in a space where they can easily talk without having to move a chair or turn completely around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Experts also tell sellers to focus on developing areas that need staging the most. “You can take your staging up a half a notch by targeting specific rooms rather than the entire home,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2017/09/12/how-to-diy-home-staging-on-a-budget/">explains Pierce.</a> “A small bedroom might call for staging because a buyer might not think the room is big enough for bedroom furniture.”</p>
<p>At the same time, don’t stress out about creating perfect spaces where they don’t exist. “If [buyers] have a great outdoor space yes [stage it], but if not, don’t go out of the way staging it, just make sure it’s clean,” says Sotuyo. “Don’t go out of your way to build one. Buyers are willing to go into a home and invest money to create a backyard area.”</p>

<h2>Decorate Like A Pro</h2>
<p>The key to staging your home on a budget is to use what you already have to re-invent the spaces in your home, making them feel cozy and stylish. Use furniture, plants, and accent pieces to highlight desirable home features. &#8220;Place an accent by a home&#8217;s feature,” advises <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/home-and-design/feature/article/2009/03/staging-budget">real estate agent Susan Cramer of California,</a> “such as an attractive plant near a fireplace to draw the eye to it.” Conversely, don’t place these things somewhere that draws attention to damaged areas or less-desirable features.</p>
<p>Spend extra time making your entryway perfect. Like all aspects of your home, the entrance should be bright, warm, neutral, clean, and inviting. Nip out any pesky residual smells (like those from pets or food) and make a clear path towards other parts of the home. “The moment the potential buyer walks into the front door they should be &#8216;wowed&#8217; by the rooms on either side of the entry,” says <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/home-and-design/feature/article/2009/03/staging-budget">real estate agent Julie C. Preston of Indiana.</a></p>
<p>Be sure to decorate your home with the curtains open and all lights on&#8211;that’s how prospective buyers will view it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3422" style="max-width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3422" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-budget-decor.jpg" alt="Staging a house on a budget: decor tips" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-budget-decor.jpg 640w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-budget-decor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-budget-decor-405x270.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image via <a href="http://www.southerncurlsandpearls.com/2017/09/empty-house-tour.html">Southern Curls &amp; Pearls</a></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Some other free ways to decorate your home like a pro include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Placing mirrors strategically to make rooms look larger</li>
<li>Digging out unused vases and accent items for a pop of color in otherwise neutral rooms</li>
<li>Using your existing inventory of decor to ensure rooms don’t appear sterile. Remember to only decorate using items everyone will like— nothing religious, political, risqué, or too gender-specific (please- no pink color schemes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, add a few personal touches to make the home feel fresh and well-loved. Remember, buying a home is an emotional decision, and buyers are more likely to be interested if a place feels “homey” and not too sterile. To do this, <a href="http://realtormag.realtor.org/home-and-design/feature/article/2009/03/staging-budget">real estate agent Lauren Scurlock of Virginia</a> advises you to “Use a little nature in each room.” She “create[s] a flow throughout the home using cuttings, flowers, dried flowers, whatever will work.”</p>
<p>You can also make visiting your home a more catered experience by leaving certain neighborhood details with your agent. “Walk Score: You can make a list all the restaurants, attractions, and coffee shops within walking distance to the property,” advises Zey. Knowing these little details are often what make buyers fall in love with a property and better able to envision themselves in it.</p>
<p>“Your mission when selling the home is to try to give prospective buyers good feelings,” says Pierce. “Most home-buying decisions are made on emotion. Make your home inviting.”</p>
<p>We couldn’t have said it any better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an ideal world you’d be selling your house after you’ve moved out. But in the real world? You might still live there. Your situation isn’t uncommon, and staging a house while living in it is completely doable, even with kids and pets.</p>
<p>Here’s our definitive guide to keep your home looking professionally staged, all while still eating, sleeping, and living there (we won’t tell if you don’t).</p>

<h2>Move Out (Physically &amp; Mentally)</h2>
<p>While it is ok to still live in your house, there’s also still some moving out that needs to happen. The best way to stage your home is to start by changing your mindset. Pretend you’re moving out now, and remove as much stuff as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Declutter surfaces, empty drawers and cabinets, and <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/stage-your-home-for-living/">place at least ⅓ of your things in storage.</a> Laura McHolm <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-mcholm/get-your-house-sold-five-_b_3861099.html">from the HuffPost says,</a> “So, here’s the secret to a successful home stage &#8211; pretend your home is already sold and you’re moving out.”</p>
<p>Consider the space to be your newest project, not your house. Says McHolm, “Think: It’s not your house anymore. It’s a house that will soon be their house. So get the YOU out of your house.”</p>
<p>What do we mean by that? You should aim to make your space looks like someone lives there— but not necessarily you. Aim for Pottery Barn status decor&#8211;don’t leave collections of Christmas cards from the last decade pinned up on the fridge. Your cousin’s kids are adorable, but they won’t win you any buyers.</p>

<h2>Clean It and Keep It Clean</h2>
<p>By now you’ve probably realized the importance of cleanliness in the successful sale of your home, but unfortunately your kids don’t care. Staging a house while living in it would undoubtedly be easier without family members to undo all of your hard work, but it can still be done.</p>
<p>The best way to start is to set a time for an initial deep-clean of your home, followed by mapping out some smaller cleaning tasks that can be conquered daily thereafter. Figure out which parts of your house are likely to get the dirtiest, and work with family members to make a cleaning schedule that keeps everything in good shape.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite hacks for staging a house with kids from <a href="http://ourconezone.com/15-tips-moving-staging-home-kids/">mommy-blogger Kelly Cone include:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning the shower while in you’re in it (seriously, how efficient is this tip?)</li>
<li>Cooking only with the oven to avoid a greasy stovetop</li>
<li>Ensuring that small kids always have wear catch-all bibs and use placemats during meal times</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.networx.com/article/staging-your-home-while-you-live-there">S.E. Smith of Networx advises,</a> “once you have your home where you want it, stay vigilant about keeping it that way so it’s always ready for a showing.”</p>
<p>Give special attention to bathrooms and bedrooms as these are the spaces that tend to come under scrutiny. Get rid of water stains and shower scum, and invest in new linens for beds. As far as kids’ rooms, Cone recommends switching out cartoon bedspreads for neutral colored blankets that match curtains.</p>
<p>She also advises getting the kids involved with the overall minimization of clutter by putting the bulk of toys in storage. Have them pick a few favorites and keep them on a small shelf where they can find a home quickly before showings.</p>
<p>One last thing: make sure you don’t accidentally pack up all of your cleaning supplies! Keeping a vacuum, duster, and Lysol wipes handy is always a good idea. Get in the habit of opening windows daily, especially after cooking.</p>

<h2>Don’t Stage Your Home Alone</h2>
<p>While so much of pre-sale prep can be done by you, there’s something to be said for calling in the professionals. A recent survey conducted by Coldwell Banker Real Estate Corp. concluded that <a href="http://www.professionalstaging.com/blog/10-amazing-home-staging-statistics-that-may-surprise-you.php">staged homes sell for more than 6% above asking price,</a> and often only spend half as much time on the market as non-staged homes. In some cases, buyers don’t even notice major property flaws when a home is well-staged.</p>
<p>When asked her opinion about hiring professional stagers, top real estate agent Maribel Sotuyo of Houston, Texas says, “If there’s something I would personally invest in when selling my house, this would be that thing.” While staging might appear to be an unnecessary extra expense, it’s actually often included in packages offered by realtors.</p>
<p>Staging isn’t just about what your home looks like during open house— it’s also a huge part of the <a href="../marketing-your-home-for-sale/index.html">great photos your agent needs to take of the property,</a> which then get posted online to attract buyers.</p>
<p>Some things you can do to prep your home for stagers is to move furniture away from doorways and get rid of bulky furniture. Says Sotuyo, “I’ve seen first-hand how a home markets before and after [staging]— it’s made a significant difference.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3416 size-full" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-while-living-in-it-help.jpg" alt="Staging a house while living it: get out of the house" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-while-living-in-it-help.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-while-living-in-it-help-300x200.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-house-while-living-in-it-help-405x270.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>Get Out Of The House</h2>
<p>The best way to keep your house looking stage-ready is to avoid spending all of your time in it, especially if you have kids or pets. Try planning activities to do outside the home, and even call on a few friends in advance that you can visit if your realtor needs to do a last-minute showing.</p>
<p>If you’re getting sick of eating casseroles and other oven-baked meals, treat yourself to a few meals out every week. It will eliminate messes from cooking and residual food smell during showings.</p>
<p>Another great idea from Cone is to put together to-go bags for every member of your family. Throw some snacks, water bottles, and extra clothes in bags for kids and adults to grab if the realtor calls. This way you can get out of the house quickly, without having to turn down a potential buyer who’s interested in seeing the property.</p>
<h2>Make A Last-Minute List</h2>
<p>Moving is a busy time, and no one expects you to remember everything. A final staging tip is to make a last-minute cleaning list for your home. Before you leave the house, pull out your list and double check that these few items are spotless and ready to be seen by buyers. Some things to consider including are: Making sure beds are made, wiping down countertops and bathroom surfaces, and double-checking that spaces used by pets and kids are tidy.</p>
<p>Keeping your home stage-ready will be challenging, but with a little family collaboration and help from professionals you can have your home ready to be seen by buyers at the drop of pin— even if you just woke up from a nap.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you own one single-family rental, an apartment building or a hundred condos across several cities, deciding to sell an investment property is full of challenges. Here are a few things to consider before and during the selling process.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3408" style="max-width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3408" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-neighborhood.jpg" alt="Sell investment property neighborhoods change" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-neighborhood.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-neighborhood-300x200.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-neighborhood-405x270.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Mission District in San Francisco has gone through significant change and gentrification in the past 10 years.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Challenge: Find the Right Timing to Sell Your Investment Property</h2>
<h3>Scenario 1: The Personality of the Neighborhood Has Changed</h3>
<p>Imagine the neighborhood as a time-lapsed video — two decades dramatically unfold in the course of just a few minutes. You see retirees move out, young families move in. You see investors swoop in and flip properties. You have a constant coming and going of renters. You see kids go from stroller to tricycle to bicycle to first car. You watch the trends in landscape design and front doors change eras.</p>
<p>The neighborhood 20 years ago might have been known for the grumpy old men who’d meet at the park every morning for cards; now it’s considered the best cul-de-sac for raising kids! Neighborhoods are constantly changing so when you sell has everything to do with to whom you sell.</p>
<p>If a neighborhood is up-and-coming, you may get top dollar for it or hang onto it as it increases further. If it’s on the decline, you may want it out of your portfolio ASAP.</p>
<h3>Scenario 2: You’re Not Sure About the State of the Market</h3>
<p>Investments are hard to time correctly … otherwise everyone would have bought Google stock back in 2004. Real estate is no different.</p>
<p>A new company moves to town, increasing the value of all the properties in the area because of demand. Conversely, a big factory may close, causing the surrounding neighborhoods to empty out or deteriorate. Just look at all the cities vying for Amazon’s Headquarters 2.0. Wherever they end up, the ecommerce giant will completely change the economy of the city — from jobs to cost of living — just like it’s done in Seattle (Headquarters 1.0) throughout the last decade.</p>
<h3>Solution: Hire an Experienced Realtor</h3>
<p>Maybe you did set up a time-lapsed video for the last two decades and know exactly what’s happened with your area. Go you! If not, talk to someone who’s familiar with how the city and neighborhood have changed. Speak with someone who has watched the change happen over the course of their career.</p>
<p>“Work with an agent that knows the formulas. It’s a very data-driven process,” says Stephen FitzMaurice, a top-selling agent in Portland, Oregon. “It’s up to the agent to present a full financial picture. Investment properties have their own language and agents need to speak that language.”</p>
<p><a href="../../index.html">HomeLight</a> can match you with a top real estate agent in your area. This person will help you determine if you should sell or hold on a bit longer. They can also help you find a new rental if you’re looking to stay in the market.</p>

<h2>Challenge: It&#8217;s Quite a Hassle to Manage an Investment Property</h2>
<h3>Scenario 1: You Live Far Away</h3>
<p>Say you bought two apartment units in Missouri back when you were 32 and living just down the street. Now you live in (or are moving to) San Diego. Being a long-distance landlord is no easy feat.</p>
<h3>Scenario 2: You Don’t Want to Deal with It</h3>
<p>As you approach retirement, you’re excited about sitting in a cafe to read the newspaper until noon on a weekday and traveling to Paris on a whim. Dealing with a tenant’s early Saturday morning email request about the leaky faucet is not the retirement you dreamed of. Though real estate is considered passive income, it’s not Paris.</p>
<h3>Solution: Find a Property Manager or Sell</h3>
<p>If you live far away or just want to be done, it may be worth it to you to hand off the management. If you have family or friends in town, great. If not, a property manager is a good option. Property managers usually charge 8 to 12 percent of the monthly rental income, plus expenses. Fee structures vary so read the fine print before you sign on.</p>
<p>If you’re over it, sell. (Did we mention HomeLight?)</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3411" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-tenants.jpg" alt="Sell investment property with tenants can be challenging" width="750" height="496" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-tenants.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-tenants-300x198.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sell-investment-property-tenants-408x270.jpg 408w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></h2>
<h2>Challenge: Tenants Can Be Difficult</h2>
<p>Selling a house when there are renters living in it is like a parent trying to get their 8-year-old to clean his room before dinner. The kid simply doesn’t care as much as the parent and he’s probably just going to shove most the mess under his bed. You can sell with tenants living in the house, but you’ll have to be creative.</p>
<h3>Solution: Give Tenants Options and Incentives</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>See if the tenants can continue their lease with the new owner.</strong> This saves the new owner from having to find tenants and saves the tenants from having to move. Win-win.</li>
<li><strong>Pay them to move.</strong> Avoid conflict altogether by paying your tenants to move. Offer a month of free rent for example. Remember these tenants will need to find a new place, so give them notice and stick to the legalities of the lease agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Incentivize a quick sale.</strong> With renters, you’re dependent on them to be accommodating to showings, pick up their laundry off the bathroom floor and keep dirty dishes out of the sink. It’s no fun for tenants to be in the middle of a story that ends with them getting kicked out of their house, so what is their incentive? Create one.</li>
<li><strong>See if the renters are interested in buying.</strong> Sometimes renters — especially long-term ones — would rather stay put. Before you go searching for a new owner, see if the current tenants are interested in taking it off your hands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge: The Cost</h2>
<h3>Scenario 1: You’re Not Making Enough Profit (or You’re Losing Money)</h3>
<p>You could own in a great housing market — like San Francisco or Los Angeles or New York, but if you’re renting out properties in those areas, your capitalization (or cap) rate is low. Sure, you’re able to charge a lot in rent but you also pay a lot in mortgage, maintenance and utility costs, so you’re not making much. It seems counterintuitive, that such a high-demand area isn’t a profitable rental market.</p>
<p>Areas that have a higher cap rate — Memphis, Oklahoma City, Cincinnati — are where you’ll make the best profit margin on your rental properties. This means the costs you’re paying (mortgage and expenses) are well outweighed by what you’re able to charge in rent.</p>
<p>Here’s a tutorial about how to <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-that-residential-real-estate-investment-property-worth-it.html">calculate your cap rate.</a> To get your bearings: San Francisco has a cap rate of about 2.7%; Memphis comes in at 7.3%, according to <a href="https://www.homeunion.com/blog/homeunion-identifies-best-and-worst-markets-for-single-family-rental-investments/">HomeUnion.</a></p>
<h3>Scenario 2: You’re Worried About Having to Pay Capital Gains</h3>
<p>If your home has appreciated, you will need to pay capital gains tax on that appreciated amount. You should also be accounting for depreciation (or else you’re leaving money on the table) Sound complicated? It’s because it is. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/rental-property.asp">Here’s a good primer.</a></p>
<p>The term “capital gains” is foreign to many, and thanks to politics has been made to sound like an insane amount of money, but we should get something straight, the capital gains tax rate (about 15%) is less than your income tax rate (likely between 25 and 39%), so making investment real estate sales and then having to pay capital gains tax on them isn’t the worst situation in the world. That said, there are a few ways to get around capital gains.</p>
<h3>Solution: Sell, Buy in a Better Area and Take the 1031 Exchange.</h3>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> You can live in the house as your primary residence for two of the five years pre-sale. You don’t pay gains on your primary residence. If you only have one rental property, this may be an option. If you have 20, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> You sell the house in the poorly performing neighborhood and you reinvest all the proceeds from that sale to buy an investment property in an area with a higher cap rate.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve just dropped your youngest off at college. You pull into your driveway; a place that once housed many cars, now has just two. You walk through the front door and in the entryway there is no hockey equipment to trip over. There’s no homework scattered across the coffee table. There’s no rustling teenagers upstairs. The house suddenly feels really big… and really empty.</p>
<p>This new season of empty-nester life might start with a good old-fashioned wallowing cry on the couch with a pint (gallon?) of ice cream while you look through baby albums. It’s different now — but it’s still home.</p>
<p>It will still be where those kids come for vacations and holidays, or if you’re lucky, every time they need to do laundry. Here are a few downsizing tips to adapt to being empty-nesters and begin the emotional and physical process of downsizing.</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3398" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-clutter.jpg" alt="Downsizing tips for empty nesters: decluttering the different spaces in your house" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-clutter.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-clutter-300x200.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-clutter-405x270.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></h2>
<h2>1. Declutter Your Home</h2>
<p>You can finally tackle some major organizing projects. If you’re looking at the possibility of moving to a smaller home, your first step is to pare down your belongings. According to <a href="http://www.seniorlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CityStash_DownsizingInfographic_FINAL1.jpg">CityStash</a>, 75 percent of those surveyed said the amount of things they own makes them reluctant to move. Don’t let that scare you off. Take one room, one closet, one square foot at a time.</p>
<h3>Closets</h3>
<p>Clear out your closet that hasn’t been purged since 1995. Are bell bottoms back in? Host a fashion show for your significant other or invite some friends over and pop open a bottle of wine. You’ll laugh your way through your 1980s blazers with shoulder pads and 1990s GUESS denim.</p>
<p>Anything you haven’t worn in a year (including shoes) must go. Sell name-brand pieces on <a href="https://poshmark.com/">Poshmark</a> or to your local consignment store. Start a box of items your daughter might enjoy. Anything else, donate to the thrift shop.</p>
<h3>Kitchen</h3>
<p>Your pantry has accumulated several boxes of mac &amp; cheese, at least 17 cans of various bean varieties and a fair number of Taco Bell hot sauce packets. Two thirds of this food is expired or stale.</p>
<p>If it’s still good but you won’t eat it, take it over to the food bank. If it’s expired, toss or compost.</p>
<p>Kitchens tend to acquire endless (sometimes useless) gadgets and appliances over the years. Start a Goodwill box for anything you don’t need — the blender you never use, that weird banana hanger you received as a gift (you don’t eat bananas), the avocado slicer (even though a knife works just fine).</p>
<p>If you have multiple sets of kitchen items, build a “starter kit” for your kids. Include dishes, silverware, small appliances and pots and pans. Though they may be living in the dorm now, they may need a first apartment setup soon.</p>
<h3>Furniture</h3>
<p>When the kids were around, you needed the utility of the chests of drawers and desk space but now that they’re gone, you have a lot of extra furniture. Host a garage sale one weekend, or put a few pieces up for sale on <a href="https://offerup.com/">OfferUp</a> or <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist.</a> Keep anchors, like beds and nightstands, but get rid of pieces that were more about function than form. You no longer need three desks for homework anymore.</p>
<h3>Files &amp; Paperwork</h3>
<p>You’ve kept everything from birth certificates to gas station receipts. With some stuff (like birth certificates) you have to save the originals. With other stuff (like gas station receipts) you can probably just record and toss. For all the stuff in the middle — bills you receive in the mail, checks and tax returns, medical records — you can scan and shred. Pick up a portable scanner and upload your important files onto an external hard drive. Eliminate boxes of files and free up office and garage space.</p>
<h3>Photo Albums</h3>
<p>If you have boxes of printed pictures, now’s the time to create albums. Scan photos into the computer and use <a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/">Shutterfly</a> or <a href="http://www.blurb.com/">Blurb</a> to create books. If you have physical 4x6s, organize and place them into sleeved albums. When your son brings home his college girlfriend, you’ll be ready to whip it out to show her all the embarrassing talent show moments.</p>

<h2>2. Give the Place a Facelift</h2>
<h3>Redecorate</h3>
<p>Your couch is a little worse for wear after having teenagers fall asleep on it, spill coffee on it, get ballpoint ink on it. Also, you weren’t about to paint the walls until your kids were no longer touching them every day. But now’s the time.</p>
<p>Visit your favorite paint supply store and pick up some paint chips and samples. Go bold (a deep blue or green) or neutral (off-white, beige or light gray). <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2017">Pantone’s Color of the Year</a> is Greenery. No matter what you do, you’ll appreciate the new hue sans grimy fingerprints.</p>
<p>Pick out a new sofa, snag an armchair at the Sunday flea market, buy a new piece of art for the dining room wall. Enjoy your new grown-up house without the worry clumsy and careless teenagers will be barreling through.</p>
<h3>Cozy up</h3>
<p>The family room that was always full of wrestling matches and card games is suddenly really clean and quiet. Cozy up the space with a large area rug; it will close in the conversation space, dampen the echo and warm the room. NW Rugs offers <a href="https://nwrugs.com/blogs/loveofrugs/12710709-top-7-rug-tips">valuable tips for colors and sizing.</a></p>
<p>Plants cozy up a space while bring the outside in. Bring a fiddle fig into the corner of your living room. Place a collection of herbs on your dining room table, an air plant on your bathroom counter or a ZZ Plant (great in darker rooms) to your laundry area.</p>
<h3>Go from Bedroom to Hobby Room</h3>
<p>Many empty nesters are hesitant to change out kids’ bedrooms, keeping the rooms the same as the day they moved out. But why waste the space? You want your college-goer to return home sometimes, but consider they can still come home and stay in the guest bedroom. Home is where family is, and when the kids visit, they’ll be delightfully distracted by old friends, family activities and all the coursework their professors have assigned over break.</p>
<p>If you have multiple extra bedrooms, convert one or two into hobby rooms. If you’ve dreamed of having a craft room since you were 16, you can finally leave that glue gun out 24/7. If you own a collection of model trains that has been sequestered to the closet for the last 18 years, you have the room to set it up!</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3400" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-busy.jpg" alt="Downsizing tips for empty nesters: keep busy" width="750" height="507" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-busy.jpg 750w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-busy-300x203.jpg 300w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/downsizing-tips-busy-399x270.jpg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></h2>
<h2>3. Keep Yourself Busy!</h2>
<h3>Plan a Party</h3>
<p>You don’t have to be quiet by 9 p.m. You don’t need to worry about your teenage boys smuggling beer upstairs in their hoodie pockets. You don’t have to run the kids off to school the next day. You can have real, live adults over for games and conversation without any concern for bedtimes, homework or curious teens. Enjoy getting to know your neighbors, if you don’t know them already. Invite other recent empty-nesters over for a dinner party.</p>
<h3>Shed a Few Responsibilities</h3>
<p>One of the bonuses of not having kids around is you’re not dependent on their schedules for vacations. Create a pre-vacation plan for when you do want to jetset. Who will deal with lawn care? The pool? Your pets? Ask neighbors, friends, arrange with a go-to dogsitter. Once you have a system established, you can easily execute it at a moment’s notice for a weekend getaway or a month-long European vacation!</p>
<h3>Curate Your Library</h3>
<p>You finally (!) have time to read. You’ve been curating a book list for years and you’re ready to hit them hard. Unfortunately, your home library has accumulated every textbook, every “free with cereal” picture book, and every magazine for the last decade. It’s in need of some pruning.</p>
<p>Take inventory. Consolidate your list of what you want to read. Determine what you’ll buy and what your library has available for check out. Then get rid of every book taking up shelf space of which you’ll never crack the spine. Sell on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay.com</a>, take them to a local used bookstore or box them up for Goodwill.</p>
<h3>House Hunt</h3>
<p>Sometimes a big house is too much. You’ve got too many bedrooms, the hallways echo when you talk to each other and you hear noises at night that you once blamed on kids, but now can’t.</p>
<p>If it’s time to start looking for new (smaller) digs, use <a href="../../index.html">HomeLight</a> to find a top-selling real estate agent in your area. They’ll help you identify something with 2 bedrooms/1 bath instead of 4 bedrooms/3 baths&#8230; and a little less echo space.</p>

<h2>How to Choose the Perfect Bedroom Colors</h2>
<p>Neutral, cool colors are largely seen as best for bedrooms. Says top real estate agent <a href="../../agents/maribel-sotuyo-tx-0655341/index.html">Maribel Sotuyo</a> of <a href="../../houston-tx/top-real-estate-agents/index.html">Houston, Texas</a>, “Blues, grays, whites, and greiges (gray-beige) are all in right now.” Cool colors are easy to pair with crisp white linens (a classic bedding choice), and leave a ton of wiggle room for accent colors and textures in throw pillows.</p>
<p>If your bedroom walls don’t fall into a neutral, cool color scheme, a fresh coat of paint is probably in order. Paint your walls with the bedding in mind, making sure the two complement each other. Mitchell recommends choosing paint with an eggshell finish, that way it will pick up all the natural light in the room.</p>
<p>While bedding and bedroom color schemes might seem like an extravagant affair, Sotuyo reminds us that it doesn’t have to be— so long as your chosen colors accomplish the goal of making the room feel spacious and elegant. Simple white bedding, without too much fluff or frill works just as well as an elaborately designed bed. The important thing with all colors in the room is to strike a balance between neutral and stylish.</p>
<p>If your room starts to feel too neutral, consider livening things up with accent items. Says Mitchell, “Place a live potted plant in the room, such as a flower on the dresser or a tree in a corner. Put colorful throw pillows on the bed to add some visual interest to the color scheme.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_3391" style="max-width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3391" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-bed.jpg" alt="When you're staging a bedroom, here's how to stage the bed." width="500" height="625" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-bed.jpg 500w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-bed-240x300.jpg 240w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-bed-216x270.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image via <a href="http://www.barefootblonde.com/2016/10/apartment-reveal-rosies-nursery-master-bedroom/">Barefoot Blonde</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How to Style Your Bed</h2>
<p>The main attraction of any bedroom is, of course, the bed.</p>
<p>If you’re lacking one, check out some <a href="https://celebratingeverydaylife.com/tips-for-how-to-stage-a-bedroom-to-sell/">ideas here for throwing a bed together.</a> Make sure your bed isn’t too big for the room, and if it is, consider propping up an air mattress on some storage boxes to create a “bed” that better fits your space (don’t worry- it’s not especially likely someone plops down for a nap during the showing).</p>
<p>Once your bed is in place, you’ll also want to be sure to get a headboard. A bed without a headboard is like a cake without frosting, and it will definitely leave the room looking flat rather than chic.</p>
<p>A lot of sellers who find themselves short a headboard <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/dreamy-and-totally-doable-diy-headboards-3017296">opt to make one</a> using a tri-fold screen and fabric, or by hanging a curtain rod with several panels behind the bed close and to the ceiling. A headboard doesn’t have to be made of solid material, it just has to lend the appearance of completeness. Headboards also work wonders in making a room feel larger— especially when they’re tall.</p>
<p>After you get your bed basics down, it’s time to consider the bedding. Says <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/a-top-decorators-bedroom-makeover-4121048">Michelle Ullman of interior designer Lindsay Pennington,</a> “When it comes to choosing your bedding, Lindsay likes to keep it simple: ‘New white bedding instantly makes a room feel updated, clean, and elegant.’ She then layers accent pillows and shams, along with an extra blanket or quilt, on top of the white bedding to give a sense of coziness to the space, and add a touch of pattern and color.”</p>
<p>Texture, patterns, and color are all things to consider when putting your bed together. Throw pillows are a great way to achieve this diversity in your designs and many <a href="http://stagingandredesign.com/2013/how-many-pillows-does-it-take-to-stage-a-home/">professional home stagers like Melissa Marro</a> recommend them highly. Says Marro, “pillows add a lot of drama, impact, color, texture, and luxury to a room.” For her staging projects she often uses up to four bed pillows and three throw pillows for a single queen-sized bed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3392" style="max-width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3392" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-furniture.jpg" alt="Staging a bedroom: the deal with bedroom furniture" width="500" height="750" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-furniture.jpg 500w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-furniture-200x300.jpg 200w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-furniture-180x270.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image via <a href="http://www.southerncurlsandpearls.com/search?q=bedroom">Southern Curls and Pearls</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Deal On Bedroom Furniture</h2>
<p>Your bedroom colors are solid and your bed is made, now what to do with the rest of the stuff in the room? In the interest of making your bedroom feel as spacious as possible, the easiest solution is to get rid of it. Mitchell suggests getting rid of everything except your bed, a dresser, and bedside tables.</p>
<p>Leaving extra items like the dresser (if you have one) or a bedside table creates opportunity for decorating surface areas, but again, the most important thing is space. If you can leave items without the room feeling small, do so. Otherwise, put them in storage.</p>
<p>Sotuyo always advocates for proper furniture placement in her clients’ homes, explaining how many buyers will lose interest if they don’t like a home’s layout. “Most buyers,” she says “once they see furniture placed a certain way, they can’t envision it otherwise.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_3388" style="max-width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3388" src="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-accent.jpg" alt="Accent pieces for staging a bedroom." width="500" height="750" srcset="https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-accent.jpg 500w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-accent-200x300.jpg 200w, https://homelightblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/staging-a-bedroom-accent-180x270.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image courtesy of <a href="http://lonestarsouthern.com/2018/01/08/room-tour-exciting-news/">Lonestar Southern</a></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Choosing Accent Pieces When Staging a Bedroom</h2>
<p>Accent pieces can do wonders to make an otherwise plain room look stylishly put-together. A great place to start is to consider the placement of your window coverings. Says <a href="http://celebratingeverydaylife.com/how-to-stage-a-bedroom/">stylist blogger Jennifer Carroll,</a> “Hang your drapes as high as possible to give the illusion of height in the room.” If you’re concerned about height, tie drapes back or choose sheer ones that don’t obscure any of your natural light.</p>
<p>Plants, vases, and wall art are also great ways to spruce up a bedroom with a neutral palette. Consider propping up wall art on surfaces against the wall to avoid any last-minute damage before your move, or use Command Strips to hang pieces in place.</p>
<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.professionalstaging.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-artwork.php">MHM Professional Staging</a> offer some great tips on how to choose your wall art, recommending abstract pieces, landscapes, still lifes, and vague renderings of people and shapes. Vases and other accent items should fall somewhere within your color scheme, offering a pop of color that deviates only slightly.</p>
<p>Strategically-placed lamps can also add a lot to a room, in addition to being another source of light. Using a wide variety of patterns in your accent items works wonders to bring a room together. Says <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/decorating-with-neutrals-4077122">Michelle Ullman</a>, “Choose a variety of patterns with different scales; you can’t go wrong when you have a mix of large, small, and in-between designs.”</p>

<h2>Keep the Space Neutral</h2>
<p>One of the best pieces of advice we’ve heard is to make bedrooms feel as neutral as possible— and not just in regard to color. Says <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/30-cant-miss-home-staging-tips">HGTV’s Lisa Laporta,</a> “When you are selling, your master bedroom should appeal to buyers of both sexes. Get rid of features that seem too gender-specific.” So hold off on the pink and lavender color schemes, and choose something everyone will like.</p>
<p>Another point is to stay neutral when it comes to wall art. <a href="http://www.professionalstaging.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-artwork.php">As advised by designers at MHM,</a> anything explicit, political, or religious should be left out of your design scheme, as should the family photos.</p>
<p>In neutralizing your bedroom, remember to keep some things in it that will make buyers fall in love with the space. <a href="http://celebratingeverydaylife.com/how-to-stage-a-bedroom/">Says Caroll,</a> “be careful that you don’t get to spare and lose all sense of style.” Use cool colors with textures, patterns, and pops of color to create a space that will speak to every buyer, and you’ll be one step closer to making them fall in love with your home.</p>
